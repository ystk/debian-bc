Description: The GNU bc arbitrary precision calculator language
 GNU bc is an interactive algebraic language with arbitrary precision which
 follows the POSIX 1003.2 draft standard, with several extensions including
 multi-character variable names, an `else' statement and full Boolean 
 expressions.  GNU bc does not require the separate GNU dc program.

Description: The GNU dc arbitrary precision reverse-polish calculator
 GNU dc is a reverse-polish desk calculator which supports unlimited 
 precision arithmetic.  It also allows you to define and call macros. 
 .
 A reverse-polish calculator stores numbers on a stack. Entering a number
 pushes it on the stack.  Arithmetic operations pop arguments off the 
 stack and push the results.
